This is just a backup of the DeadPeopleTileset, originally by @SomeDeadGuy. As it's no longer available in the Cataclysm DDA repo itself, only the primary tileset is included, as the UndeadPeopleEdition was solely a development tileset named to not compete with the version in CDDA's repository, and was otherwise identical to the version preserved here.

Also preserved are the optional GUI-altering mods specific to the original repo, the Russian and German translations of SDG's original readme, and the content list.

I might, MIGHT, one day resume spriting myself to keep this up to date, if I find myself less busy. We'll see.

Original readme content follows.
